# SimpleECC
A simple implementation of the elliptic curve cryptography principles. All in java

## Background
I got interested in Elliptic curve cryptography after reading the book **Mastering bitcoin** by  Andreas M. Antonopoulos. 
After trying to find some learning material online on how to make your own implementation I found the results lacking. 
So I decided to implement my own version of Elliptic curve math and key generation. I tried to make the implementation 
as clear as possible. 

I am no security expert by any means. So This repository is mostly meant to be used for learning by those who
 are interested and not for any serious implementation (as if anyone would use this crap anyway).
